============================================

Code accompanying the "Comments on comments to Herb Sutter's updated GotW #6b 
solution" series of Dibase blog postings.

Shared Immutable Exclusive Setup (SIES) is the best name I could come
up with at short notice for the usuage pattern under discussion.

Use:

    make

to build libraries and applciations.

Use:

    make test

to build unit tests (requires Catch from philsquared - use 

    git submodule update

to pull down Catch source).
